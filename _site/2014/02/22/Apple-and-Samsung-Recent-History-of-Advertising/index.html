        <h1>Apple And Samsung: A Recent History Of Advertising</h1><br>

		2013 has been labeled by many as the lost year in tech, devoid of any disruptive new product categories. The main media focus was on lobbying for tax laws, mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs (and even floating offshore tax havens). It&rsquo;s hard to argue any of these did much for the industry from a consumer perspective, but it&rsquo;s easy to overlook other important aspects of this industry.<br />
		<br />
		Advertising, in particular, is has been changing a lot. Advertising by tech companies has quickly evolved over the last few years, and competitors have increasingly influenced and responded to each other through their campaigns.<br />
		<br />
		As far back as I know, impactful advertising in this industry began with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA">1984 Super Bowl commercial</a>. It&rsquo;s important to understand the context of this commercial, in order to appreciate it fully. This was at a time when Apple&rsquo;s fiercest competition was IBM who was at the time selling mainframe computers. Apple, meanwhile, was trying to commoditise the home computer. They chose to portray rigid mainframe computers, sold mostly to governments and large organizations, as inflexible and unattainable to the masses, while they were meanwhile empowering people. The 1984 big brother analogy was a powerful one.<br />

		<br />
		In the advertising industry, it&rsquo;s still regarded as one of the best advertisements, ever. But Apple has changed the focus of it&rsquo;s advertising a lot since then. And IBM isn&rsquo;t even a player in this industry anymore (arguably, even Microsoft, Apple&rsquo;s big competitor after that, isn&rsquo;t particularly relevant).<br />
		<br />
		The most interesting companies in advertising, in my opinion, are Apple and Samsung, especially due to their rivalry. While Google (Apple&rsquo;s biggest competitor), LG, Microsoft, Blackberry and others have also played an important role, I&rsquo;ll mostly focus on philosophical differences between how Samsung and Apple advertise, and how it's changed.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Consistency</b><br />
		<br />
		When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, one of his first actions was to fire the advertising agencies that Apple used at the time and shift to exclusively using Chiatt/Day, forming a close partnership with them. This was a successful move for Apple, not only due to consistent quality of advertising, but it also helped Apple shape a general consistency and theme throughout all of their advertising. <br />
		<br />
		For Samsung, their company uses a mismatch of different ad agencies, with whom they lack a very close relationship. This has resulted in some deplorably <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8nJKWJTsUg">awful ads</a>, or ads whose <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2t6CVika6o">message is unclear</a>. Of course, Samsung has some better ads too, but I&rsquo;m still in search of a really good one to post. If they had cut <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgGRklW6QAk">this</a> at about 1 minute, I think it could have commanded some praise.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Product versus Personal</b><br />
		<br />
		Apple once again rose to prominence along side tons of product centric advertising. Apple became very famous for this style of advertising (like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9mbjgm3MoE">original iPhone ads</a>), and due to this many their ads today look exactly like those from a decade ago.<br />
		<br />
		Yet this is the domain in which Samsung has probably impacted Apple&rsquo;s direction the most. Samsung chose to focus much more on the people. And while this didn&rsquo;t work out very well initially, it has since proven quite successful. In fact, since Apple started to mimc Samsung in creating ads with this focus, they&rsquo;ve produced many of their best. Some of the best ads I&rsquo;ve ever seen, perhaps. <br />
		<br />
		The key is in how Apple has started to tie the product, and its features, to the people, family, and friends that use it and the impact it has on their lives. A few recent examples of this are (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhwhnEe7CjE">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhwhnEe7CjE">here</a>). These evoke so much more emotion than the product-centric ads Apple is famous for, and it&rsquo;s hard not to see why they&rsquo;re now taking a larger priority. Apple&rsquo;s product updates have fewer new features every iteration, and they&rsquo;re an established and well known company - now they&rsquo;re trying to convey the emotional rather than known technical, design or intuitive sides of their products.<br />
		<br />
		And the same time, Samsung has started to release some more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW6hFtwmE8E">product-centric</a> ads which feel very much like those of Apple (albeit perhaps trying to be more grandiose than they successfully project. There&rsquo;s now a clear convergence of the scope of the advertising of these two companies.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Local versus Global Advertising</b><br />
		<br />
		Here Apple and Samsung once again posses contrasting philosophies. Apple puts a tremendous effort into keeping their advertising consistent, which is easy when it comes to their product centric ads that can simply be narrated in any language. However, an increasing number of their advertisements profile users of their products, which are often reshot scene-for-scene in various languages with nearly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoE9XxXUatA">identical actors</a>. A consistent image is very important for Apple who appears to shy away from locally targeted ads which would add some more subjectivity to their message.<br />
		<br />
		For Apple, this is more than a policy, it&rsquo;s a part of their philosophy. Steve Jobs once told his advertising team in Paris &ldquo;Listen. You probably don&rsquo;t want to hear this, but &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want you guys to be too creative.&rdquo;, continuing &ldquo;We work really hard to create great campaigns here, so Apple has one voice around the world. We don&rsquo;t need you to create new ads, we need you to do a great job of adapting our campaigns for your countries.&rdquo;<br />
		<br />
		Samsung, meanwhile, has taken the other approach, as we can see in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhM-DuM2WgE">this</a> ad made for an audience in Iceland. I think the ad speaks for itself, and while I can&rsquo;t comment on how it was received in Iceland, it certainly lacks the budget and feels much less professional than even Apple&rsquo;s worst ads (arguably their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-yoqIlNS8Y">genius advertising campaign</a>). Samsung&rsquo;s continued commitment to localised advertising, including their &lsquo;booth babes&rsquo; and somewhat sexist product introductions in some parts of the world, continue to hurt it&rsquo;s reputation in others.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Attack and Ambush Marketing</b><br />
		<br />
		It&rsquo;s tempting to write off this area of marketing as outright tacky altogether, but there is some strategy behind it and it has been done better at times. When Apple was an ailing company, their legal department nearly withheld the release of an ad stating the Power PC processors Apple computers used outperformed Intel. Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t let that happen, offering two reasons: firstly, through Apple making the comparison, even if it was untrue, it would at least put the question into people&rsquo;s minds, and secondly, if the ultra-successful Intel came after the struggling Apple with a team of lawyers and a lawsuit, Apple would easily win the PR war. Intel must have reached the same conclusion, as they didn't respond.<br />
		<br />
		More recently, Apple had a very long-running <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA265ZVXuq8">attack campaign</a> against Microsoft. Ultimately this campaign was ended when it was seen as too arrogant on Apple&rsquo;s side. Since then, to my knowledge they haven&rsquo;t delved into this area of advertising (with the possible exception of the awful genius campaign above).<br />
		<br />
		While searching for Samsung ads online, it&rsquo;s hard to find any that aren&rsquo;t either blatantly attacking Apple [or worse, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNxDd3l0lEU">Apple Users</a>], or at least making a subtle jab at Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;artistic barista&rdquo; types (to which I believe Apple has indirectly responded by highlighting the intersection of artistic and professional uses of its product, in its latest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiyIcz7wUH0">iPad commercial</a>.<br />
		<br />
		Attack Ads are common for the underdog, but I wish Samsung would outgrow it. They should have enough to say about their own products by now. They spend far more on Marketing, and some really bad ads, than they should, and it&rsquo;s recently started to chisel away at their market cap. Yet, their foray into attack advertising extends even further to ambush marketing (i.e., marketing by intrusion). The Australian launch of the iPhone 4S was overshadowed by a Samsung tent set up a few meters away offering the Galaxy S II for $2 to their first 10 customers. <br />
		<br />
		Predictably, the Pandora&rsquo;s Box Samsung opened has since been a weapon against it from the likes of LG and others.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Originality</b><br />
		<br />
		It&rsquo;s hard to comment on this aspect without a much more intimate knowledge of Advertising than I posses, however while I&rsquo;ve noted that Apple and Samsung have adopted each others ad styles (both now producing product and people centric ads), there are also some more shameless copies.<br />
		<br />
		Here, in 2007 Apple debuts the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bvfs4ai5XUi">iPhone</a>. While here, in 2013 Samsung debuts the iPhone, erm, I mean the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3qeJKax2CU">Galaxy Gear</a><br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>2014 and Onward</b><br />
		<br />
		It's hard to predict what these companies will choose to focus on going forward. If Apple and Samsung jump into new product lines, as they're rumoured to, it may command an entirely different focus or style for the ads. Similarly, market changes and a wealth of other external factors promise to impact this industry, so it will be very interesting to see what happens in this industry if 2014 doesn't eclipse 2013's lost year in tech.<br />
