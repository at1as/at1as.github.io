        <h1>The 21st Century Analogue to the Second Amendment</h1><br>

		Typically, I keep my distance from such polarised issues, since it only stands to encourage the incalculable amount of time spent deliberating comparatively trivial issues. However, in this case I think it&rsquo;s worth putting the Second Amendment into its proper context. <br />
		<br />
		If you think its primary focus is about preserving or restricting the right to a cellar full of guns, as I fear most people do, then sadly you&rsquo;re missing the point entirely.<br />
		<br />
		At its time of inception, the Second Amendment was about securing a balance of power between the government and its citizens. Historically - with many examples today - governments that have been able to mandate a great power imbalance in their favour, have have tended towards violence and oppression rather than safety and liberty.<br />
		<br />
		In this sense, today&rsquo;s debate over the Second Amendment should have nothing to do with guns; the debate should be about its principle: securing the balance of power.

				<li> international protection from governments that don&rsquo;t grant all of the above</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<br />
		In many ways, the West has been working towards restricting each of these freedoms for decades, and for the most part it&rsquo;s going unnoticed, or being met with considerable apathy. <br />
		<div style="margin-left:45px">
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li> nobody is naive enough anymore to believe we&rsquo;re not all being surveilled, yet the brief public backlash demanded nothing of the government</li>
				<li> countries like Germany the UK have begun to outlaw encryption </li>
				<li> British papers have started sending their articles to be published in America due to (democratically unprecedented) threats of criminal charges</li>
				<li> every Western country is engaged in bi-lateral spying, information exchange, and extradition</li>
			</ul>

		So, while the US continues to battle over gun policy, take note of the war that&rsquo;s increasingly being lost.
