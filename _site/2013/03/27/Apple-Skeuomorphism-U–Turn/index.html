        <h1>Apple's Skeuomorphism U&#8211Turn</h1><br>

        Personally, I think the controversy surrounding Skeuomorphism debate feels somewhat synthetic; something the Apple marketing team has been actively trying to stir up. Perhaps not foolishly. Apple has failed to excite for quite some time, and equally worryingly, appears to spend most of its time on the defensive &#8212 a foreign stance to the company since the release of the iPod. The last two years of very incremental updates from Apple, has likely played a significant &#8212 if not dominant &#8212 role in the rise of Google and Microsoft in industries Apple once stood unchallenged.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the release of iOS 7 and the manner through which Apple presented it itself at WWDC, it is clear that for better or worse, and after a sustained period of self&#8211doubt, Apple is as aggressive and confident in themselves as they have ever been. Until recently, it was clear Apple employees weren't stashing Zunes in their pocket, or PCs in their homes, but I imagine some Samsung phones have started making an appearance. Genuine belief in their work can be a very powerful marketing tool, and this is what Apple wants back, and wants to convince its employees as well as its users of.

        It was clear to many that towards the end of Job's reign, Apple began to lose its design consistency. Apps such as Find my Friends, or Find my iPhone, which had no physical counterparts, were having every inch wood panelled, leather&#8211bound and stitched. It was not only rather hideous design, it was also purposeless.

        The skeuomorphic approach Apple began to follow (that is, making applications look like the physical devices they are emulating) generated perhaps its harshest criticism, albeit amongst some scattered praise. 
        <br>
        <br>
        So, let's look at a few examples of this design in Apple's ecosystem: the infamous tape deck in the podcast app (the first victim of Apple's rebranding), a leather-bound calendar, a yellowed paper notes app, and a wooden bookshelf for iBooks, amongst a growing list of others.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's start with the tape deck podcasts app. For this example, we might ask ourselves if tape decks are actually useful analogies; that is, was their design guided by a certain intuition all humans have, providing the simplest and easiest to visualize metaphor for the device's purpose? Would independent societies have designed them in exactly the same way (Apple would often proudly state that for much of their UX, the purity of the design solves problems that simply couldn't be solved any other way. They had not found a solution, they had found <i>the</i> solution. Yet even Apple never possessed the arrogance to claim this about any of their Skeuomorphic designs)? 
        <br>
        <br>
        Or was the tape (and subsequently the tape deck) influenced by physical, logistical and cost constraints? We know that physical tapes roll up a long line of film, which has magnetic imprints that store information which is essentially read from one end to the other. If we're half way done our tape, we're reading the location of the film that is precisely between its two extremities. For the sake of argument, time is linear and constant (forgive me, physicists, but the subtleties of relatively are probably lost on most iOS users), indicating that circular rolled up tapes likely distort the information we can extract from them. A linear seek is a much clearer analogy. Could we take a step further and eliminate the concept of seek altogether and simply display the time played and time remaining? Yes, however some visual analogies, like a visual representation of a fraction, can be easier for us to understand.
        <br>
        <br>
        Had tapes only recently ceased production, perhaps their incorporation into modern designs would still make sense. However, now that a significant (and increasing) portion of iOS customers will have never interacted with physical tapes, and there is no reason to believe they will in future, the analogy is no longer useful. And this is exactly the point, skeuomorphism should provide useful analogies, but only while they're actually being useful. Most of these analogies are not eternal.
        <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the most infamous example was that of Game Center. The green felt billiard table was the provided interface for users to sign into the games they were playing. The proportion of published iOS billiards games is sure to be low, calling into question the motivation for this particular design, but more worryingly, it was ugly, which is not typically a part of Apple's repertoire. Video Games have &#8212 for the most part &#8212 never been designed to emulate physical games; their purpose is typically to take the user out of this world and into whatever world the game is portraying. To then require the users to sign in through a portal that looks like they've been transported to a dingy 1930s casino, ruins rather than enhances this experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Similarly, are users so dense that they require leather stitched calendars in order to have any hope of understanding the interface? Straying not far outside of the physical calendar realm may make sense, but that certainly doesn't mean we need tacky stitching to remind ourselves of its purpose. It's not just a Skeuomorphism argument, it's a design argument. I wouldn't consider buying a physical calendar that looked as hideous as iCal.

        <br>
        While there is a lot of just Skeuomorprhic criticism going around, on the other hand, pages that <i>flip</i> the way books do might be a good use of Skeuomorphism. Many of the people I know will still go well out of their way to read a physical book, even when it's a more costly alternative (unlike the market for tape decks or billiard tables). Further, everyone using iOS will have had experience with physical paper and understand the metaphor. We also have reason to believe that paper, and our contact with it, will be around for quite some time yet. For the same reason, the bookshelf in iBooks isn't necessarily a terrible or outdated analogy.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am certainly not, in most cases, a proponent of Skeuomorphic design. However, I understand that there is a compromise somewhere in between. Flat designs can be beautiful, but they can also be hideous and unintuitive. Similarly, Skeuomorphism can be elegant and simple, or be ugly and capable of sending an even more confusing analogy to the user. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I hold a cautious optimism regarding the future of iOS and its convergence to a more consistent interface, devoid of all the noise that comes along with Skeuomorphism. Admittedly, I wouldn't say I'm happy to see all of the textures go (I quite liked the Mission Control background, for instance), or entirely sold on the proposition of transparency to add a visual indication of depth to a UI, but I think Apple is making its first step in the right direction.
