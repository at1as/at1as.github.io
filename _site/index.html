<h1>Apple And Samsung: A Recent History Of Advertising</h1><br>

		2013 has been labeled by many as the lost year in tech, devoid of any disruptive new product categories. The main media focus was on lobbying for tax laws, mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs (and even floating offshore tax havens). It&rsquo;s hard to argue any of these did much for the industry from a consumer perspective, but it&rsquo;s easy to overlook other important aspects of this industry.<br />
		<br />
		Advertising, in particular, is has been changing a lot. Advertising by tech companies has quickly evolved over the last few years, and competitors have increasingly influenced and responded to each other through their campaigns.<br />
		<br />
		As far back as I know, impactful advertising in this industry began with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA">1984 Super Bowl commercial</a>. It&rsquo;s important to understand the context of this commercial, in order to appreciate it fully. This was at a time when Apple&rsquo;s fiercest competition was IBM who was at the time selling mainframe computers. Apple, meanwhile, was trying to commoditise the home computer. They chose to portray rigid mainframe computers, sold mostly to governments and large organizations, as inflexible and unattainable to the masses, while they were meanwhile empowering people. The 1984 big brother analogy was a powerful one.<br />

		Typically, I keep my distance from such polarised issues, since it only stands to encourage the incalculable amount of time spent deliberating comparatively trivial issues. However, in this case I think it&rsquo;s worth putting the Second Amendment into its proper context. <br />
		<br />
		If you think its primary focus is about preserving or restricting the right to a cellar full of guns, as I fear most people do, then sadly you&rsquo;re missing the point entirely.<br />
		<br />
		At its time of inception, the Second Amendment was about securing a balance of power between the government and its citizens. Historically - with many examples today - governments that have been able to mandate a great power imbalance in their favour, have have tended towards violence and oppression rather than safety and liberty.<br />
		<br />
		In this sense, today&rsquo;s debate over the Second Amendment should have nothing to do with guns; the debate should be about its principle: securing the balance of power. The 21st century balance of power doesn&rsquo;t depend on weapons, it&rsquo;s increasingly about information. To stay empowered, citizens need an explicit right to:<br />
