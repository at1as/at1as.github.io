<h1>Apple's Skeuomorphism U&#8211Turn</h1><br>

        Personally, I think the controversy surrounding Skeuomorphism debate feels somewhat synthetic; something the Apple marketing team has been actively trying to stir up. Perhaps not foolishly. Apple has failed to excite for quite some time, and equally worryingly, appears to spend most of its time on the defensive &#8212 a foreign stance to the company since the release of the iPod. The last two years of very incremental updates from Apple, has likely played a significant &#8212 if not dominant &#8212 role in the rise of Google and Microsoft in industries Apple once stood unchallenged.
        </p>
        <p>
        With the release of iOS 7 and the manner through which Apple presented it itself at WWDC, it is clear that for better or worse, and after a sustained period of self&#8211doubt, Apple is as aggressive and confident in themselves as they have ever been. Until recently, it was clear Apple employees weren't stashing Zunes in their pocket, or PCs in their homes, but I imagine some Samsung phones have started making an appearance. Genuine belief in their work can be a very powerful marketing tool, and this is what Apple wants back, and wants to convince its employees as well as its users of.

<h1>A Primer on cURL</h1><br>

<div id="subheading">
	<div id="blogdatestamp" style="font-weight:bold;font-family:times;text-align:center;"><i>08 Mar 2013</i></div>
	<div id="blogtext">
		I was introduced to testing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful APIs</a> long before I started web development. Perhaps the most indispensable resource available to me was <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a>, which is a command line utility to send and receive data from servers. I've since encountered various alternatives, and supersets, however none of them has ever been truly as lightweight and easy to set up, use and understand as cURL.<br />
		<br />
		When we test using cURL, we&rsquo;re really performing the same actions our browser is, but we&rsquo;re able to both send and receive data much less ambiguously, more clearly verify the server is operating as expected, and more easily test things like valid data ranges. Removing the layer of abstraction that the webUI introduces (let alone the variation in the way different browsers react to the same data), enables us design and test our APIs much more confidently.<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<h2>Setup</h2><br />
		If you&rsquo;re on a Mac or a Linux PC it&rsquo;s as simple as opening terminal and entering the commands we discuss! (also, type &ldquo;man curl&rdquo; for the included user manual) <br />
