		I was introduced to testing APIs long before I started web development. Perhaps the most indespensible resource available to me was cURL, which is a command line utility to send and receive data to servers. I've since encountered various alternatives, such as Python's PycURL, and Ruby's Typhoeus, however none of them has ever been as lightweight and easy to set up, use and understand as cURL. If you're on a Mac, or a Linux machine, it's as easy as opening up Terminal and entering some of the commands we'll go over below.

		cURL provides a very pure interface to s


		In this post, I'll do a very quick overview of how to use cURL in order to test websites


		Requests are sent by the webUI, which will accept the responses to these requests that are sent by the server. 
		Although the webUI will send these requests directly, testing the REST API directly can provide a lot of insight into the structure of Madra, and provide a useful debugging tool, removing several layers of abstraction. Ideally, the REST API should provide exactly the same validation as the front-end (with respect to valid values, ranges, etc.). This article will provide a very brief look at how Madra utilises the REST API and how to test this using the cURL command-line tool.

		<b>HTTP Requests</b>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The REST API uses four main HTTP methods (although the list is expanding quickly) to interact with content: GET, PUT, POST & DELETE:
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<ul style="margin-left:45px">
			<li><b>GET</b> is used to retrieve content, without making any modifications</li>
			<li><b>POST</b> and <b>PUT</b> are used to create or update resources. There are subtle differences between them (generally a POST is used to update and element, or add to a queue, while a PUT is used to replace an element), but it depends somewhat on the program architecture. In this case, simply follow the REST API Wiki on which to use for each particular command since Madra makes use of both.</li>
			<li><b>DELETE</b> is used to remove a resource</li> 
		</ul>
