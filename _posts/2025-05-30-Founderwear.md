Over the past decade, I've spent most of my time in and around startups â€” from early-stage teams through IPOs in Silicon Valley to tech communities in New York. Along the way, I've picked up on a lot of the quirks, inside jokes, and shared language that tend to follow founders around. There's something genuinely special about that environment â€” the energy, the optimism, the unwaivering desire to do something impactful and to change the world. I wanted to capture and preserve a bit of that spirit in a simple, tangible way.

ðŸŽ‰ <b>Founderwear</b> is a small side project I started to turn some of those observations into something wearable â€” featuring apparel and accessories inspired by tech culture, startup life, and a healthy dose of optimism for the future. You'll find references to things like fundraising, pivoting, YC, and demo days (with a dash of AGI) â€” the kinds of references that will be engrained in the minds of those who have gone through the process.

I've always liked the idea of building small things in public, and this one was a chance to combine a few interests â€” tech, design, and a bit of founder humor. Thanks for checking it out.
