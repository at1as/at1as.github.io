        Those that have studied some mathematics may recognize an analogue signal as one that can be represented by a continuous
        mathematical function. <span class="inlineCode">y = sin(x)</span> yields a precise answer for any possible inputs,
        no matter how granular they become, the answer will always slightly change.
        A binary signal, meanwhile, is represented as combinations of 1's and 0's, discarding everything in-between.
      </div>
      <div class="blogText">
        A VGA cable attached to a projector is analogue: the signal is of highly variable quality
        (which becomes especially noticeable when very long cables are used). An HDMI cable, meanwhile, is a binary signal;
        the picture is either on the TV or it's not.
      </div>
      <div class="blogText">
        While there are a lot of reasons why binary is the great tradeoff that ushered in almost all of the technology we depend on,
        binary representations of analogue signals will always discard part of that signal. In some applications, 
        it's not important. But perhaps in others it is.

      <div class="blogSubheading">We might use this analogy to explore the 2016 Election.</div>

        I, as a prospective voting age individual, may hold thousands of opinions on the topic of economics alone. 
        Politics is actually much more complicated than this, as it's broad enough encompass many economics-sized topics all at once.
      </div>

      <div class="blogText">
        Of these combinations of thousands of views, which could feasibly manifest as government policies,
        perhaps only hundreds are represented on the political spectrum, and they are themselves interleaved across several parties
        (usually the majority of which align with non-mainstream parties with no real possibility of being elected).
        
      <div class="blogText">
        This creates a few interesting challenges. One must first asses the relative priority of the opinions they have that
        are actually represented by any of the candidates, then use this to select the best-match candidate,
        and then reprioritize around the broader and more ambiguous scale of strategic voting and weighing local versus federal representation.
      </div>

      <div class="blogText">
        When you discount this level of complexity from politics, you're left with almost exactly what you had before.
        <span class="blogBold">Politics is not an analogue signal, it's a fiercely binary one.</span>
        This has led to a major disincentive to stay continually engaged, learn about the foundations and structure of the system we vote under,
        or try to understand our "opposition". 
      </div>

      <div class="blogText">
        MSNBC and FOX News are products of a binary political system. The Economist, however, represents a more analogue one.
        One the Economist's mantras, "Not read by millions of people" is clever, but also rather telling when compared 
        to the number of FOX and MSNBC viewers.

      <div class="blogSubheading">So, back to politics. What does this mean for your average voter?</div>

      <div class="blogText">
        A few things appear to stand out:
      </div>

      <ul class="ul-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
        <li class="li-blog">
          on average, your well informed voter should probably be a disenfranchised voter
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          ideological allegiances typically don't make sense, unless you can prioritize a particular group of traits 
          attributed exclusively to a particular party exceedingly high above all others
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          political parties are not time invariant. Labour in the UK shifted towards the economic right for several decades under Tony Blair,
          before electing a self proclaimed Marxist to lead them
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          philosophies are not time invariant either. Mainstream economics, one of the primary foundations for politics,
          has swung rapidly from Keynesianism to become overwhelmingly neo-classical, and now it's trending back again
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          Voters are not time invariant. To put it bluntly, when old people die, new ideas flourish
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="blogText">
        Given this, it would make sense for voters to be left with many more questions than answers during a given election cycle.
        It may still be possible to definitively select a candidate to support, but even this is a very idealized view of how politics actually works. 
      </div>

      <ul class="ul-blog">
        <li class="li-blog">
          What can the candidate reasonably achieve, given full reign (0% unemployment may be easy to promise, but a mathematical impossibility to achieve)
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          What can the candidate actually achieve given many constraints :
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          What is likely to happen during midterm elections?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          What is likely to happen if they run for another term?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          Who is likely to take the Senate, who is likely to capture the House?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          Who currently sits on the Supreme count? What are their leanings?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          How will the party internally be divided?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          What does a constitution, bill, executive order, or omnibus bill permit?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          How easy is it to make a promise versus implementing it?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          What are the implications of breaking a promise, once elected?
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          How often does a candidate waiver on their opinions? How do their policies waiver form state-to-state and primary to federal election
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          And most importantly in my opinion :
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog" style="margin-left:40px">
          What does a candidate really believe? A career politician may not always be easy to read
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="blogText">
        All of the above are why I've never been strongly in favor of one party in an election, and might be skeptical of those who are.
      </div>

      <div class="blogSubheading">Elections are part pragmatism, part values, and part personal experiences.</div>

      <ul class="ul-blog">
        <li class="li-blog">
          A small business owner struggling to pay their employees may draw a different prioritization between minimum wage increases and health care reform than a salaried employee
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          A laid off Auto Worker's Union member who has felt the personal effects of globalization may draw a different prioritization of free trade versus social values than a wealthy college student
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          An unwavering environmentalist may wish to cast a losing vote for the green party – rather than vote for the social values they align with within a mainstream party – simply to make a strong environmental statement 
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          A libertarian, like myself, may wish to vote for a minority party that won't win, simply because they see this as a mechanism to have these policies gain acceptance into mainstream parties
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="blogSubheading">The take aways</div>

      <ul class="ul-blog">
        <li class="li-blog">
          <span class="blogBold">The two party system is archaic</span> and should be replaced with a system that allows for a larger diversity of opinions and less arbitrary grouping of policies together. We don't vote for natural groupings of policy, we simply inherited these
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          Favor making politics something personal and private rather than a spectator sport. <span class="blogBold">You probably can’t change anybody’s opinion except your own</span>
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          By having many different voters that vote on many issues that are important to them, you begin to approach a proportional electoral system. If 6% will vote based on a balanced budget, <span class="blogBold">parties must adapt to gain those voters</span>. I think this is a great virtue within a terrible first-past-the-post electoral system 
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          <span class="blogBold">Politics is complicated.</span> Too complicated for most voters, and a few repeated points will usually drown out the necessary nuances. Politics is not a Venn-diagram, it’s more like a graph database or neural network. 
        </li>
        <li class="li-blog">
          <span class="blogBold">We are a product of our environments</span> : whether we grew up rich or poor, whether we've dealt with loss or had an easy life – these skew the importance of many of our values. It would be arrogant to insist that others vote for the same values we do if we don't come from the same experiences. A checkmark on a piece of paper for you may be a home foreclosure, or the end of a struggling business for someone else
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div style="blogText">
        A final takeaway, and perhaps the most contentious one : there are things that politics can achieve. But it may be much easier to impact the world by impacting politics indirectly, or simply staying far from it.
