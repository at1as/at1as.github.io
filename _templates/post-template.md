Write your post content here using Markdown formatting. The first paragraph will automatically get special styling with a drop cap.

## Headings Use Markdown Syntax

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- Bullet lists
- With multiple items

1. Numbered lists
2. Work too

> Blockquotes look like this and are styled nicely

You can add `inline code` or code blocks:

```javascript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Images

![Alt text for image](path/to/image.jpg)

### Links

[Link text](https://example.com)

---

You can use horizontal rules to separate sections.

**Bold text** and *italic text* work as expected.
